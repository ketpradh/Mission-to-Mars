# Mission-to-Mars by Ketaki
This project helps the user Robin to build a custom Mars website using web scraping methods and tools and libraries of BeautifulSoup, Splinter, PyMongo, Pandas and Flask. Data is stored in MongoDB. We have used BootStrap 3 to style the website.
## For Deliverable 3- 
- The text is bold using STRONG tag in the Bootstrap 3 CSS style.
- The Scrape button color is changed to light blue as it's a Info button.
- The page is also  mobile-responsive using col-md and responsive button and **img-responsive** class.
